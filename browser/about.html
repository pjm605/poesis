          <h3>Poesis is a browser-based development environment and analytic engine for poetry. It annotates text to make poetically significant verbal features visually accessible. </h3>

          <h3>Poesis currently supports three annotation modes: </h3>

          <h3>The Phonetics mode colors phonemes that occur within the poem more frequently than they do in standard prose, thereby visually illustrating alliteration and assonance effects. </h3>

          <h3>The Rhyme mode, straightforwardly enough, colors the last syllable of rhyming lines. </h3>

          <h3>The Meter mode colors the vowel at the heart of each syllable either blue, if the syllable is stressed, or red, if it is unstressed. The text on the Meter button will change to display the name of the poemâ€™s meter, while this mode is active. </h3>
