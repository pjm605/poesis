# Poesis

Poesis is a browser-based development environment and analytic engine for poetry created by Angela Choi, Janice Park and Hannah Ketznelson as a capstone project at Grace Hopper Academy in October 2016. It annotates text to make poetically significant verbal features visually accessible. 
It currently supports three annotation modes: Phoentics, Rhyme, and Meter.

It was built with Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, CodeMirror API, HTML, jQuery, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Gulp, Bluebird, Request promise, Mocha, and Chai.
